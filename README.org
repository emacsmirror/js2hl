Highlight/rename things using [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode][js2-mode]] parser.

It's based on "js2r-highlights.el" by Mihai Bazon.

See [[http://lisperator.net/blog/emacs-and-javascript-in-2017/]].

I clean the code to make this program only dependent on [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode][js2-mode]].

Things are variable or its property, strings, numbers, names like "this" or "super". It uses parser of [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode][js2-mode]]  to extract correct things.

=M-x js2hl-rename-thing-at-point= to rename things at point. If its optional parameter N > 0, only occurrences in current N lines are renamed.

=M-x js2hl-add-namespace-to-thing-at-point= to prepend namespace to the thing. The separator of namespace is from `js2hl-namespace-separator'.

=M-x js2hl-show-exits= to show exit points from the function surrounding point. That is, =return= and =throw= statements.

=M-x js2hl-forget-it= to exit highlight mode.

=M-x js2hl-move-next= and =M-x js2hl-move-prev= to move between the highlights.
