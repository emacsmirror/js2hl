Highlight/rename things using [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode][js2-mode]] parser.

It's based on "js2r-highlights.el" by Mihai Bazon.

See [[http://lisperator.net/blog/emacs-and-javascript-in-2017/]].

I clean the code to make this program only dependent on [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode][js2-mode]].
